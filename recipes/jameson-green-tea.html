        <h2 class="greentea">Description</h2>
        <p class="greentea-body">The original Green Tea Shot, also called the "Jameson Green Tea" was created by Jameson Irish Whiskey. Therefore, it is best to use their Irish whiskey to get the cocktail flavor that was intended when the Green Tea Shot was created. However, you may use other Irish whiskey, American whiskey, or even bourbon if you prefer.</p>

        <p class="greentea-body">Despite its name, Green Tea Drink is not green tea infused but rather named after its unique, green color. Don't be surprised to learn that this delicious, alcoholic drink doesn't actually contain any green tea. In fact, this cocktail has a perfectly harmonious blend of sour and sweet flavors typically enjoyed on warm summer days.The Green Tea Cocktail is a fun, tasty, and super easy-to-make drink and you should definitely give it a try!</p>
