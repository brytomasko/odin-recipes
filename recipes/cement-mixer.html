        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The cement mixer shot is both one of the most popular shot drinks and, in some opinions, one of the most disgusting. Why it has endured is a great mystery in the bar world. The reason may have a lot to do with the reaction of those who drink it and the laugh their friends get out of watching it go down.</p>

        <p>The drink itself does not taste badâ€”citrus and cream are not a poor combination. The real problem is the texture; it is named the cement mixer because it's imagined to be a lot like drinking concrete. If you have a tendency to gag on certain food textures, this shot is probably not for you. It can be a hard drink to get down and there are plenty of tastier shooters to enjoy instead.</p>
