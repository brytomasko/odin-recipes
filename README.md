Odin Recipes Project

With my first project I will be demonstrating my ability to create and clone a github repository, setup an index.html file from memory without using the ! shortcut, create a repository using the command line, use touch command to add 3 .html recipe files with images that are linked in the index.html file, add ordered and unordered lists, test my code on google-chrome, and how to commit and push to github.
